### N-queens
*  Paper used to implement: [3,000,000  Queens in Less Than One Minute](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/122319.122325)   
*  Another paper: [Queen search](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/79d2/fa13d4a5cfc02ff6936b6083bb620e4e0ce1.pdf)
*  This is the C++ code I used: [million queens](https://github.com/yanshengjia/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/million-queens). This C++ code solves ten million queens in 10 seconds. The logic is the same. I heard other group also find this repository (since it has 200+ stars). I tried to change the variable names and made some function changes.
*  Check out their report [last year, same method](https://github.com/deepweaver/1MillionQueens?fbclid=IwAR0IZCpTpz5FtJxxu97-wK8zxpj3MdOLPi9hHkVIOTWSazbvGt_uVFxtxgc)    
    
    
TODO:   
* Create a validation program. Check if the solution is correct 
* Code optimization? I tried numpy. But it seems does not have an improvement.
* Finish Report
